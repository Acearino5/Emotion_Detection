# Emotion_Detection

Greetings,

This model aims to identify the seven different human emotions from PNG images.
The dataset used to train the model is too large to upload to Github
I have included the link to the dataset at the start of the notebook

*Please Note:*
If you want the project to work on your personal machine:
1.Please add the training images to the folder called train
2. Please add the test images to the folder called test

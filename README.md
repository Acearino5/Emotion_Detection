# Emotion_Detection

Greetings,

This model aims to identify the seven different human emotions from PNG images.
The dataset used to train the model is too large to upload to Github
I have included the link to the dataset at the start of the notebook

*Please Note:*

If you want the project to work on your personal machine:
1.Please add the folders called train and test to the main directory of the project
2. The train folder should consist of 7 more folders labeled with different emotions and containing PNG images
3. The test folder should consist of 7 more folders labeled with different emotions and containing PNG images
